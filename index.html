                Why did i choose to study Software Engineering??
               
            </h1>
            <img id="tech-photo" src= "../images/technology.jpg" width="=100" height="100">
            <p>Ever since i can remember - I have been extremely interested with using technology specially
                when i played with the first nokia phones and learning to use the internet when it first started.I Would
                love to build an app one day which would help people in any way possible.</p>
                
            <p> Another Reason why i chose to study software Engineering is so i can understand automation and also internet of things. 
                These days devices are speaking to each other with given instructions. For eg a home security camera can be activated from your 
                mobile phone to turn on or off and also the kettle!.</p> 

             <p>Software Engineering will open doors for me to work in new fields due to the ever changing world of technology. I would like
                to develop and illustrate coding into our everyday lives and to make it as simple as possible so that everyone can learn and benfit from it.
                Another reason why i chose to study software engineering is because i would like to enhance and make better security programs. i beleive
                stronger encryption and firewalls to make the internet and use of applications a lot more safer for everyone.</p>

             <p>I also have a keen interest in the world of cloud and recently completed my Azure fundamentals certificate. The world of cloud storage
                and computing is highly interesting as we can now pretty much operate from anywhere and not have to rely on huge in house IT and hardware.
                its very interesting to know how our information is kept in the clouds and how they are kept safe through extremely well designed encryption software.</p>

             <p>If possible i would really like to work in the field of cloud developer - as this industry is only growing rapidly and this will give me a great chance
                to consistently learn and apply new concepts. I am very inspired by Mark Zuckaberg and Elon musk who are constantly innovating and bringing more knoweledge into
                the world of software angineering. The Next Thing i would really like to learn is Artifical Intelligence and machine learning and how these two combined are changing
                the world rapidly and bringing change to people's lives. The more positive and productive peoples live become the more i want to learn about the world of software engineering 
                as spiderman says "with great power comes great responsibility!".</p>
            
             <p>I am greatful that i am able to study this course at Academyxi and the fact that it fits into current life schedule very well. I believe in learning and passing
                on knowledge and this course wll give me the oppurtunity to expand and enhance my sklls and knoweledge even more.</p>
                
                
                In summary - the reasons why i want to study software Enginnering is listed below!!!
             </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Strong interest in Applications</li>
                <li>keen interest in how computers and servers talk to each other</li>
                <li>Would like to create my own app one day</li>
                <li>To gain a better understanding of technology/innovations</li>
            </ol>
